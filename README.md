# cpp_weekday_index_validator
This Weekday Index Validator program (C++) asks the user to enter an integer that represents the day of the week 
(1 - Sun, 2 - Mon, 3 - Tues, etc.).

If the number provided is out of range, the user is prompted to re-enter an integer. Once a proper integer is entered, the program asks the user if they would like to continue or quit. While loops and selection logic are used for program reuse and data validation.

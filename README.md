# cpp_weekday_index_validator

This Weekday Index Validator program (C++) validates whether the user entered an integer that represents a day of the week (1 - Sun, 2 - Mon, 3 - Tues, etc.).

If the number provided is out of range, the user is prompted to re-enter an integer. Once a proper integer is entered, the program asks the user if they would like to continue or quit. While loops and selection logic were utilized for program reuse and data validation.
